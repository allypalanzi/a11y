						It’s important to not think of disability as something that only effects a subset of users. It’s not something you can tell from your analytics, you can’t see who’s using a screen reader on your webpage, and there’s not a great way to test for if folks are only using keyboards to interact with your site.

						It’s important to realize that disability can effect anyone at some point in their life, or even all within a day. A user who might be using your website with a mouse one morning could have a child in their arms later that night, and only able to interact with your page via a keyboard.
						<br><br>
						Microsoft Design has built out extensive and fascinating guidelines on inclusive design. In it, they include this awesome image that shows different states of disability. It can really be all over the place, and we should plan for that.

						your product should be usable,
						older users should be able to use your site,

						and a word all important execs and clients  like to hear: SEO. If a screenreader can access your site properly, so can google’s indexing crawler.

						Also scary legal things! Companies like Netflix and Sweegreen have already experienced lawsuits for having accessibility issues.

						Things like creating internal tools that employees are required to use to get their job done, if inaccessible, might mean that you can’t hire as diversely as you should, or it might mean you’re disadvantaging disabled employees to do their job.

						This is especially important for us at Vox as we create tools for our reporters to publish content on our websites.

						<br><br>
						So we reached out to Viget!! And Jeremy Fields came up to our offfice for an afternoon to talk about all things accessibilty.

					<h1>How can we share them with the world?</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						When we first wrote all of these docs, we had talked about open sourcing them however it was out of scope for the two day hackathon. Because of our successes with sharing it within the company, we really wanted to figure out how to share it with the world.

					<aside class="notes">
						One of my teammates, a designer, Sanette, had started including an accessibility check list when working on projects.
						<br><br>
						Because of how she was using these docs, we thought that a checklist builder might be useful for everyone.
						<br><br>
						So after two days — we launched acccessibility.voxmedia.com
						<br><br>
						We have the site divided into the same sections we created documentation for — designers, engineers, projects managers, qa, and editorial, and it allows you to select the items relevant to your projects and outputs a list for you to copy out at the end. It also includes tons of links to resources and tools.
						<br><br>
						We got a lot of love for it on the internet! And even a few open source contributions. This was exciting for us!!
